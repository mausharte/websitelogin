Here I have included all of the files I created and used for this assignment. 
I used php to script the website login and registration. For the front end I used html and css.
I am having some issues with accessing and uploading my files to my domain using hostgator, but should have them uploaded ASAP.
The domain I have reserved is https://maushartevan.com 
I apologize for the late submission. I was, and currently still am if you are reading this, having issues accessing and uploading my files to my domain.
I will update this page and my domain as soon my domain provisioning is complete.
